Professor Ben Yeh and team members Yuxin Sun, Korawan Vijittrakkarnrung, and Maurice Heimer, presented on their research developing novel CT and MRI contrast agents.  These developments were motivated by the lack of CT contrast agents, particularly for visualization of the bowels and bowel disease, and challenges in CT of dilution, specificity, and ambiguity when using multiple agents.

The studies presented focused on DBCM, a novel experimental Dark Borosilicate Contrast Material.  This has completed Phase I and II clinical trials, and is currently undergoing FDA approval from Nextrast, a company co-founded by Dr. Yeh!

They showed detailed phantom studies on the contrast provided, impact on resolution and reconstruction algorithm, as well as extending DBCM for use as a MRI contrast agent.

It was an excellent case for targeted bowel disease contrast agent that addresses challenging tradeoffs of delivery, dose, and contrast.
